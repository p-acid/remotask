# Phase 0 Research: Telegram Slash-Command Surface

**Feature**: 004-slash-commands
**Date**: 2026-05-02

Each entry resolves an open decision raised in `plan.md`. After this phase, no `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` markers remain in Technical Context.

---

## R1. setMyCommands placement in the runtime lifecycle

**Decision**: Spawn `setMyCommands` as a **background asyncio task** at the
start of `Runtime._async_main()`, alongside (not before) `listener.run()`.
Both run concurrently on the same loop. Failure logs a warning + emits an
audit event but never blocks the listener — `Runtime._ready` flips to True
the moment the listener task is created, regardless of registration outcome.

**Rationale**:
- Best-effort posture (FR-002) is enforced by the task model itself: the
  await on `listener.run()` is independent of registration progress.
- The listener's own startup precondition validation (002 §III) already
  rejects malformed bot tokens before we get here, so the "wait for first
  successful getUpdates to prove the token works" sequencing earlier
  iterations of this contract considered would not catch failures any
  earlier than the precondition check already does.
- A slow/unavailable Telegram server cannot delay `remotask telegram start`'s
  CLI-side readiness poll, which is what surfaces to the operator.

**Alternatives rejected**:
- *Await registration before listener.run()*: blocks listener startup on
  Telegram availability — exactly the failure mode we want to avoid.
- *Sequence after first getUpdates ok*: implicitly couples registration to
  the long-poll's first round-trip, which 002's precondition validation
  already does for token validity.
- *Register on every getUpdates success*: wasteful, and Telegram rate-limits
  `setMyCommands` per bot.
- *Re-register periodically*: complexity for no operator-visible benefit
  (Telegram caches the command set persistently).

## R2. bot_command entity offset semantics

**Decision**: A message qualifies as a slash-command invocation if and only if its `entities` array contains a `bot_command` entity at `offset == 0`. Entities at non-zero offsets are treated as ordinary text within the args.

**Rationale**:
- Matches BotFather convention and Telegram's own client behaviour (autocomplete only triggers when typing `/` at start).
- Avoids unwanted dispatch from a casual sentence like "I think we should `/cancel` that idea" — that `/cancel` is at offset > 0 and is therefore plain text.
- Keeps the parser deterministic: one command per message, always at the front.

**Alternatives rejected**:
- *Match any bot_command entity*: opens up accidental dispatch from quoted text, replies, etc.
- *Regex on raw text without entities*: ignores Telegram's own annotation, which is the source of truth and handles edge cases (e.g. `/run` inside a code block — an entity is *not* emitted there).

---

## R3. `@<botname>` suffix handling

**Decision**: When normalising the command, strip a trailing `@<botname>` segment (case-insensitive). The bot's own username is fetched once at startup via `getMe` and cached in the runtime. Commands `/run` and `/run@curious_claude_notification_bot` collapse to the same canonical `run`.

**Rationale**:
- Telegram clients automatically append `@<botname>` in groups when multiple bots are present, but never in 1:1 DMs. Both forms must work without operator awareness.
- The bot identity is already authoritative (we hold the token), so the suffix carries no new information.
- Caching `getMe` once at startup avoids one extra round-trip per dispatch.

**Alternatives rejected**:
- *Reject suffix forms*: breaks the multi-bot-in-group case.
- *Match suffix dynamically per call*: redundant network calls.

---

## R4. Synthetic topic naming for free-text `/run`

**Decision**: Topic name = `run-<YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM>-<slug>-<6-hex>` where:

- `<YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM>` is the daemon's UTC time at session insert.
- `<slug>` is the first ≤ 20 chars of the args, lowercased, ASCII alnum + dash only (collapsed runs of disallowed chars to a single dash, trailing dashes stripped).
- `<6-hex>` is `secrets.token_hex(3)` — six lowercase hex digits.

The full string is also stored in `sessions.issue_key`, satisfying 002's same-issue concurrency rule (FR-010) trivially because the hex suffix makes collisions astronomically unlikely.

**Rationale**:
- Human-readable in the Telegram topic list — operators can scan their topics and recognise what each was about without opening it.
- Hex suffix prevents accidental collision when two `/run` invocations land in the same minute with similar args (e.g. dictation on a phone retry).
- Stays under Telegram's 128-char topic name limit comfortably.

**Alternatives rejected**:
- *UUID v4 only*: opaque, not human-readable.
- *Sub-second timestamp*: harder to read in topic titles, no real benefit over the hex suffix.
- *LLM-generated topic name*: latency + LLM cost for a tiny benefit; out of scope per spec.

## R5. `/status` snapshot atomicity and limit handling

**Decision**: A single SQL query:

```sql
SELECT id, issue_key, status, started_at, log_path
FROM sessions
WHERE status IN ('enqueued','starting','running')
ORDER BY enqueued_at DESC
LIMIT 11;
```

If 11 rows return, the reply renders the first 10 with a trailing "+ 1 more (truncated)" hint. The shape is:

```text
ZXTL-1234        running    iteration 3/5     2 min ago
run-2026-05-02…  starting   —                  18s ago
+ 0 more
```

**Rationale**:
- Single read = consistent snapshot.
- 11 = 10 + 1 lets us detect overflow without a separate COUNT query.
- Fixed-width-ish layout (fixed-pitch font in Telegram) makes the reply scannable.
- Iteration index is read from the most recent `PROGRESS` line in the per-session log; for sessions that haven't emitted a PROGRESS yet, dash.

**Alternatives rejected**:
- *Pagination*: out of scope per spec.
- *Real-time progress query*: would need a runtime API; fixing this in DB is enough for the use case.

## R6. `/run` argument parsing

**Decision**: Split args on the first `\s+` once. If the first token matches the 002 issue-key regex (`^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]{1,9}-\d{1,6}$`), use it for routing and store the rest as `sessions.trigger_text`. Otherwise the whole args string is free-text → fall back to `agent.default_project_jira_key`.

**Rationale**:
- Single token detection is unambiguous and matches operator intuition (`/run ZXTL-1234 also add tests` is "run on ZXTL-1234, also do this").
- Free-text path lets operators dictate intent without remembering Jira keys (the headline UX win).
- Storing the rest as `trigger_text` preserves the operator's request verbatim for audit and future LLM use.

**Alternatives rejected**:
- *Always treat first token as Jira-key candidate even when no `-`*: wasteful.
- *Require explicit prefix flag (`--key=ZXTL-1234`)*: friction; operators will forget.

---

## R7. setMyCommands failure recovery

**Decision**: A failed `setMyCommands` call (network error, 5xx, 429) logs a `WARNING` and sets `listener.state.commands_registered = false`. **No in-process retry.** The next listener restart re-attempts. Inbound dispatch continues to work — only the autocomplete menu is potentially stale.

**Rationale**:
- A retry loop here is hard to bound (we'd need backoff that doesn't conflict with the listener's own backoff). Simpler to lean on listener restarts.
- The cost of a stale menu is small (operator types the command anyway) so we don't need aggressive recovery.
- Audit log gets a `commands_registration_failed` entry so the operator can see the failure on `remotask telegram status`.

**Alternatives rejected**:
- *Retry with backoff in-process*: extra state machine for tiny win.
- *Crash the daemon on registration failure*: violates fail-soft posture.

## R8. Privacy Mode interaction with backwards compatibility

**Decision**: The dispatcher's slash-command branch and 003 plain-text branch are independent. Slash commands work regardless of Privacy Mode. Plain-text triggers continue to depend on Privacy Mode being OFF (the bot must be allowed to read non-mention text).

We document Privacy Mode OFF as the recommended posture (clarification Q1) but do **not** force it in code — the operator may flip it on for slash-only UX.

**Rationale**:
- Forcing Privacy Mode OFF would require a `setMyCommands`-adjacent call (`setMyDefaultAdministratorRights`?) we don't otherwise need.
- Leaving the choice to the operator preserves user agency.

**Alternatives rejected**:
- *Auto-disable Privacy Mode at startup*: reaches into BotFather settings the operator may have intentionally configured.
- *Refuse to start unless Privacy Mode is OFF*: too restrictive given slash-only is a valid mode.

---

## R9. Audit-event taxonomy

**Decision**: Four new event constants in `daemon/audit.py`:

| Constant | Bound to session? | Where written |
|---|---|---|
| `EV_SLASH_COMMAND_RECEIVED` | yes (the affected session) | `session_events` row |
| `EV_SLASH_COMMAND_REJECTED` | no | `audit.log` only |
| `EV_COMMANDS_REGISTERED` | no | `audit.log` (one line per success) |
| `EV_COMMANDS_REGISTRATION_FAILED` | no | `audit.log` + WARNING |

Reject reasons (`EV_SLASH_COMMAND_REJECTED.payload.reason`):
`unauthorized` | `wrong_chat` | `unknown_command` | `main_chat_done` | `no_active_session` | `no_default_project` | `empty_args`

**Rationale**:
- Mirrors 003's audit pattern — session-bound when we know the session, unbound otherwise.
- Reject reasons are explicit enums so dashboards / log searches stay clean.

**Alternatives rejected**:
- *Single `slash_command_attempted` with status field*: harder to filter "show me only rejections".

---

## R10. Curated command registry as source of truth

**Decision**: A single new module `src/remotask/telegram/commands.py` exports a frozen list of dataclasses:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class CuratedCommand:
    name: str          # "run", "done", "status" — no leading slash
    description: str   # ≤ 256 chars, BotFather-style
    requires_topic: bool       # /done is True; /run, /status are False
    requires_args: bool        # /run is True; /done, /status are False

CURATED_COMMANDS: tuple[CuratedCommand, ...] = (
    CuratedCommand(name="run",    description="Start a new session", requires_topic=False, requires_args=True),
    CuratedCommand(name="done",   description="End the current session", requires_topic=True,  requires_args=False),
    CuratedCommand(name="status", description="Show active sessions", requires_topic=False, requires_args=False),
)
```

`setMyCommands` serialises `name`+`description`. The dispatcher imports the same tuple and dispatches by `name`. A unit test pins the tuple shape so accidental drift is caught at PR time.

**Rationale**:
- Single source of truth eliminates the failure mode where the menu shows a command the dispatcher doesn't handle (or vice versa).
- `requires_topic` / `requires_args` flags push validation logic out of the handlers and into a single guard.
- The frozen tuple is trivially testable.

**Alternatives rejected**:
- *Define commands inside the dispatcher itself*: fine for now but creates coupling between menu and dispatch logic that grows over time.
- *YAML / TOML registry*: over-engineering for three commands.
